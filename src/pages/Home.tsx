          <p>This project was created because of lot of hours spent searching, trying and debugging. There are several articles and projects about Relay, but those are mostly using older versions, or it is just a small sample of a code without other major parts. Here is a complete web application with everything you need to start using React, Relay and GraphQL.</p>

          <p>I am sure you can find several things that can be coded better, or are not clear. And it really needs tests to be a fully complete project. So if you have time, I would be very happy if you can write me some feedback, or even create a pull request.</p>
